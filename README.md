This Project majorly contains a To Do list app, where the user can enter the list of tasks needs to be completed and a pomodoro clock for each task, that enables the user to time their work efficiently with the pomodoro technique.

This project was implemented using React Native with typescript, such that the built application is compatible on all platforms such as Desktop Web, Android and IOS.

The code base is split up as two components such as - Pomodoro where the pomodoro timer technique is implemented, and ToDo where the to do task list is implemented, where the user will be able to create, edit and delete the task, and each task gets a pomodoro timer such that the user has the facility to time their work based on this technique for a efficient time management for any of their given tasks.

For a given task User can set a timer of 25 minutes and gets a break of 5 minutes after each cycle and then repeats the cycle and after 4 such cycles user takes a long break.
